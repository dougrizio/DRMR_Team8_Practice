## Git

Git is a version control system (VCS) - a category of software tools that helps software developers manage changes to source codes over time. Git is free, open source, and is the most widely used version control system in the world.

Git, like other version control systems, creates a record of every modification made to the codes in a development project database. However, Git is an example of a specific type of VCS known as a distributed version control system - rather than storing a project's revision history in one single place, a DVCS makes every developer's copy of the code a repository that is able to access the whole project's complete history of revisions. This enables multiple developers distributed across different locations to monitor and coordinate their individual changes to code, and facilitates collaboration between people without disrupting the consistency of the project workflow.

Distributed version control systems such as Git have multiple advantages over alternatives:
- Enabling fast branching and merging
- The ability for developers to work offline
- Eliminating the reliance on a single project backup

While there are several platforms for distributed version control, Git stands apart from the rest because of its unique branching model: Git enables developers to create multiple branches of code that can be entirely independent from each other. The creation, merging and deletion of those branches can also be done extremely quickly.

Compared to other systems, Git makes development faster, more reliable, and less prone to errors.
