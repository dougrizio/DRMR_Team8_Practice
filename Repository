# Term: Repository

In Git, a repository (also known as a "repo") is a storage space for a development project that includes all of the project's files as well as a record of each file's revision history.

Through the use of Git repositories, multiple developers can work together on a project at the same time, charting each other's edits and updating their own files without interfering with anyone else's workflow.
