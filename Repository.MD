*Repository*

In Git, a repository (also known as a "repo") is a storage space for a development project that contains all of a project's files, as well as a record of each file's revision history.

Through the use of Git repositories, multiple developers can work on a project at the same time - Git lets developers create their own personal copies of a project's main repository, edit files indepedently of each other, monitor the updates done by coworkers in other repositories, and merge their separate work into a single version of the project.
