### Working in Teams

THe Gitflow method easily scales regardless of team size. Using git, git hub and other versioning tools team members have their own sandbox to work on the assigned feature. If they are called away to assist on another project they can just pick-up roight where they left off. Although it woulld be beneficial to commit and push whatever changes were in progress.
