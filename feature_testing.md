## Automated Testing

Automated Testing is the process of allowing software to detect and make changes to code without having to rely on the lengthy task of manual human revision. This is often used to quickly catch bugs introduced into the code when implementing new features, and can greatly reduce the amount of errors that often occur when working on a development project.

Automated Testing is often a key component of continuous integration, wherein developers make small, frequent updates to their shared repositories to minimize large changes to code infrastructure. Each integration made can then be verified by an automated build and automated tests.

Github automatically has several automated features embedded into its platform: for example, the detection of merge conflicts during pull requests for new commits.
